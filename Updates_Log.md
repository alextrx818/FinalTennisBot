### Tennis Bot Improvements

#### Summary
Today's work focused on improving the Tennis Bot's matching logic and logging capabilities. We enhanced the system's ability to pair events between BetsAPI and RapidAPI, particularly focusing on bet365_id extraction and fuzzy name matching. The logging system was also significantly improved to provide clearer insights into the matching process.

#### Key Changes

1. Tennis Merger Logic Improvements
   - Added bet365_id extraction from RapidAPI's eventId format
   - Implemented three-tier matching strategy:
     1. Primary: Match by extracted bet365_id
     2. Secondary: Match by marketFI
     3. Fallback: Fuzzy name matching for unmatched events
   - Enhanced player name normalization for better matching accuracy

2. Logging System Enhancements
   - Improved match statistics reporting
   - Added detailed breakdown of:
     * Total unique matches
     * Successfully paired matches
     * RapidAPI-only matches
     * BetsAPI-only matches
   - Enhanced unmatched event logging with player names and IDs
   - Better formatted output for readability

3. Code Organization
   - Removed circular imports in tennis module
   - Updated module docstrings
   - Cleaned up redundant comments
   - Added proper type hints and documentation

4. Repository Management
   - Initialized git repository
   - Created .gitignore for Python projects
   - Set up GitHub integration with HTTPS authentication
   - Created Git_Save_Push.md guide for future reference

#### Current Statistics
- Successfully matching ~45 events between APIs
- Average match rate: >90%
- Processing time: ~2-3 seconds per fetch cycle

#### Next Steps
1. Monitor the improved matching logic in production
2. Fine-tune fuzzy matching thresholds if needed
3. Consider adding more detailed logging for edge cases
4. Continue optimizing the matching algorithm based on real-world data
